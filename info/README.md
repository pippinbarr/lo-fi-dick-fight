# Lo-Fi Dick Fight

## Warning: Flash

This game was exported in Flash and, as you probably know, Flash has been discontinued.

If you happen to have an ancient computer that still runs Flash in the browser, or a copy of the Adobe Flash Standalone Player, you should be able to run the original game.

At some point I may port the game to JavaScript or similar, and it's possible that the [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) Flash emulator will get to a point where this game will run again. Let's see.

There is a somewhat-working HTML5 export of the game as well, which you can have a go with.
